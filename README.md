An application was created that can be used in a car shop: to manage vehicles, warehouses, users and comments. A working database was created and order management was implemented. Although most of the tasks were successfully completed, it is also worth mentioning personal achievements, for example, a better understanding of how the SQL database works and improved skills in working with the Java programming language.

Major changes occurred during the project, and each step encountered various challenges that were successfully overcome, so the project provided a lot of benefits. It is obvious that this project still has shortcomings and can be improved: details need to be polished, logical errors corrected and the overall operation of the system improved. One of the main shortcomings is the separation of users. Although an employee is different from a customer, an even greater distinction should be introduced between the tasks available to an ordinary employee and an administrator.

In summary, this project achieved the set goals and at the same time gained work experience step by step, which will be useful in future projects.
